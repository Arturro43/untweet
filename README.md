# untweet
Delete all of your posts, likes and retweets on X/Twitter easily. Reduce your digital footprint, take back some control of your data.

1. [DamnFastMassTweetUnliker (DFMTU)](https://gist.github.com/Arturro43/3b54fbdffc332a07361595a6c290fa75) - remove all of your liked tweets from publicly available "liked" section. Script works so fast even Elon won't have enough time to destroy Twitter.

USAGE: Go to your profile, click on "liked" section, press F12, choose Console and paste [DFMTU script](https://gist.github.com/Arturro43/3b54fbdffc332a07361595a6c290fa75). Press ENTER.

Note: You are gonna get rate limited after 500 unliked tweets (about 10 seconds). When this happens just refresh page, wait 15 minutes and paste script once again.

Note #2: "You donâ€™t have any likes yet" error when it's pretty obvious you have some left is a bug or some sort of rate limiting. They'll come back in 2 minutes, 2 hours, 2 days, 2 weeks. You can't do anything about it. 

Note #3: Firefox users, this script is currently unstable. It works even faster on Firefox, but it's so damn fast it causes some glitches so please follow https://github.com/Arturro43/untweet/issues/1 for help.

2. [X-twitterminate (XT)](https://gist.github.com/Arturro43/6b8e81d77aef9a0f3945eb351bf571a2) - remove all of your Twitter tweets (posts), retweets (reposts) and comments. Basically clean up your account.

USAGE: Go to your profile, press F12, choose Console and paste [XT script](https://gist.github.com/Arturro43/6b8e81d77aef9a0f3945eb351bf571a2). Press Enter.

Note: You can get rate limited for loading too many tweets. I'm not sure about the current limits, so if tweets are not loading or something weird happens - refresh site and run script again.

Note #2: I can see I have some posts left but they are not loading!!!!!! What do?!?! Read Note #2 in the DFMTU section.

Current roadmap:

- resolve any issues, more testing
- create all in one script with a simple gui
- rework XT script to work on any resolutions
- automate script
- more user friendly experience (idk, some onboarding with hello what is your username and auto navigate to profile or some shit)
